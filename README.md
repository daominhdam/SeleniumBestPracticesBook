# Running Tests With Ruby

To run our Selenium tests with Ruby programming language, we will first need to install several dependent components. We will start by installing "bundler," which is a very good project dependency manager.

To install bundler, run the following command in your terminal:  
```
gem install bundler
```

Once the bundler gem is installed on your computer, navigate to the root of this project (Make sure the Gemfile is in the current directory) and run the following command:
```
bundle install
```
